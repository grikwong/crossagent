# Crossagent — AI Agent Instructions

## What This Project Is

Crossagent is a cross-model AI agent orchestrator with a browser-based Web UI. It ships with builtin `claude`, `codex`, and `gemini` agents, and each workflow phase can be reassigned to any registered static agent.

Default phase mapping:

1. **Phase 1 — Plan**: `claude`
2. **Phase 2 — Review**: `codex`
3. **Phase 3 — Implement**: `claude`
4. **Phase 4 — Verify**: `codex`

## Memory System

Crossagent has a persistent memory system with three tiers:

- **Workflow memory** (`memory.md` in the workflow directory) — per-workflow decisions, findings, and session notes. Initialized on `crossagent new` and updated by each phase agent.
- **Project memory** (`~/.crossagent/projects/<name>/memory/`) — per-project patterns, conventions, domain knowledge, and feature context. Shared across all workflows in a project. May contain a `features/` subdirectory with feature-level memory files.
- **Global memory** (`~/.crossagent/memory/`) — cross-project patterns, conventions, and accumulated knowledge. Updated when agents discover broadly reusable insights.

Memory flows into prompts via memory context builders that inject all three tiers (workflow -> project -> global) into each phase prompt. Each prompt also includes memory update instructions telling the agent how to update memory at each tier after completing its work.

- `prompt.BuildMemoryContext()`, `prompt.BuildMemoryUpdateInstructions()`, `agent.BuildLaunchArgs()`, `agent.GenSandboxSettings()`, `prompt.GenerateGeneralInstructions()`

Project memory is also wired into:
- Launch args — added as `--add-dir` so agents can read/write project memory
- Sandbox settings — added to `allowWrite` so agents have write access
- General instructions — listed in workspace directories and memory system description

The `crossagent memory` CLI subcommand manages memory:
- `crossagent memory show [--global|--project [name]] [--json]` — display memory content
- `crossagent memory list [--global|--project [name]] [--json]` — list memory files
- `crossagent memory edit [--global|--project [name]]` — open memory in editor

## Projects

Workflows are grouped under projects. Each workflow has exactly one parent project (defaults to `default`). Projects provide:
- Scoped memory shared across the project's workflows
- Organization of related workflows
- Auto-suggestion of the best project for new workflows

The `crossagent projects` CLI subcommand manages projects:
- `crossagent projects list [--json]` — list all projects
- `crossagent projects new <name>` — create a new project
- `crossagent projects delete <name>` — delete (moves workflows to default)
- `crossagent projects show <name> [--json]` — show project details
- `crossagent projects rename <old> <new>` — rename a project
- `crossagent projects suggest [--description <text>] [--json]` — suggest matching project
- `crossagent move <workflow> --project <project>` — move workflow to project

## Go Conventions

- Two external dependencies: `github.com/creack/pty` (Unix PTY) and `github.com/gorilla/websocket` (WebSocket server) — both for the embedded web server
- Atomic writes via temp file + rename pattern to prevent partial-write corruption
- File locking (flock) for concurrent `SetConf` calls
- Embedded templates via `embed.FS` in `internal/prompt/templates/`
- State files use a simple key=value format
- Tests use `t.TempDir()` with swappable `homeDir` for isolation

## Web UI Conventions

- The Web UI is an embedded Go HTTP/WebSocket server in `internal/web/`, served via `crossagent serve`
- API handlers shell out to the crossagent binary for complex operations (guarantees JSON compatibility)
- All user input is validated server-side before processing
- PTY sessions use `creack/pty` + `gorilla/websocket`; launch params come from `crossagent phase-cmd --json`
- Frontend uses vanilla JS, no build step — xterm.js, addon-fit, and marked are vendored in `public/vendor/`
- WebSocket protocol: `spawn`, `input`, `resize`, `kill` from client; `output`, `spawned`, `exit`, `error` from server
- Chat history is captured per-session with a 50MB buffer cap, flushed atomically on exit/kill/disconnect

## Layered Architecture

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full decision record.

1. **Core layer** — Go packages (`internal/`) provide state management, agent orchestration, prompt generation, and verdict judging. The CLI entry point is `cmd/crossagent/main.go`.
2. **Integration layer** — `--json` output on `status`, `list`, `phase-cmd`, and `agents`.
3. **Web UI layer** — Embedded Go HTTP/WebSocket server in `internal/web/`. Serves frontend assets, REST API, and terminal sessions.

Critical boundaries:
- Web UI never writes to `~/.crossagent/` directly — it calls `crossagent advance`/`done` for state changes
- Web UI owns PTY sessions; the Go binary provides launch params via `crossagent phase-cmd <phase> --json`
- Web UI exposes agent management through CLI `agents` commands, not direct config writes
- No orchestration logic is duplicated outside the Go core

## When Modifying the CLI

- Supported agent adapters are `claude`, `codex`, and `gemini`
- Sandbox-fallback artifact recovery: OS-level sandboxes (notably gemini's `--sandbox` seatbelt profile on macOS) may deny writes to `~/.crossagent/workflows/<name>/` if paths are not canonicalized. Crossagent now automatically resolves all symlinks (e.g. `/Users` vs `/private/var/users`) and explicitly authorizes the `~/.crossagent` home directory to ensure write access to all state. If a fallback still occurs, the state helpers `state.RecoverMisplacedOutput` and `state.RecoverWorkflowOutputs` relocate files from the repo root (agent CWD) back into the workflow directory. Recovery is wired into `crossagent advance`, the Web UI's `/api/workflow/{name}/check-file` polling, and `/check-advance`; users see a yellow "Sandbox-fallback: relocated …" line in the terminal when it triggers. Any new code path that asserts the presence of a phase-output file should run recovery first via `state.RecoverWorkflowOutputs(wfDir, repo)` so behavior is consistent.
- Maintain the phase gate pattern: each phase checks prerequisites before running
- All output files (plan.md, review.md, verify.md) are written by the launched AI, not by crossagent itself
- The workflow dir is always passed as `--add-dir` to both adapters
- Agent adapters are plugins: create `internal/agent/adapter_<name>.go` implementing the `Adapter` interface (Name/DisplayName/DefaultCommand/Plan) and call `RegisterAdapter(<yourAdapter>{})` from `init()`. Everything downstream (builtin-agent list, CLI validation messages, Web UI dropdown, `LaunchAgent` dispatch, `BuildPhaseCmd` dispatch, `TestAdapterRegistry_*` contracts) reads from the registry — no other code changes required. The current builtins are `claude`, `codex`, and `gemini`
- Prompt templates live in `internal/prompt/templates/` as embedded `.md.tmpl` files
- Verdict parsing must handle case-insensitive matching and various phrasings
- Run tests with `make test` (runs `go test ./...` then integration tests)

## When Modifying Go Packages

- Use atomic writes (`atomicWrite`) for any state mutation
- Agent adapters are plugins: create `internal/agent/adapter_<name>.go` implementing the `Adapter` interface (Name/DisplayName/DefaultCommand/Plan) and call `RegisterAdapter(<yourAdapter>{})` from `init()`. Everything downstream (builtin-agent list, CLI validation messages, Web UI dropdown, `LaunchAgent` dispatch, `BuildPhaseCmd` dispatch, `TestAdapterRegistry_*` contracts) reads from the registry — no other code changes required. The current builtins are `claude`, `codex`, and `gemini`
- Prompt templates live in `internal/prompt/templates/` as embedded `.md.tmpl` files
- Verdict parsing must handle case-insensitive matching and various phrasings
- Run tests with `go test ./internal/...`

## When Modifying the Web UI

- The web server lives in `internal/web/` — `server.go` (routing), `api.go` (handlers), `terminal.go` (WebSocket+PTY)
- API handlers use `exec.Command` to shell out to the crossagent binary for JSON-producing operations
- Validate all inputs server-side (names, phases, artifact types)
- Don't add a frontend build step — keep it as plain HTML/CSS/JS
- Frontend assets are embedded via `go:embed all:public` in `embed.go`
- Vendored browser libraries (xterm.js, marked) live in `public/vendor/`
- Test by running `make start` (builds binary then launches `crossagent serve`)

## Before Pushing

Always run the full CI check suite locally before pushing to avoid CI failures:

```bash
go vet ./...
go test ./...
staticcheck ./...                    # install: go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@v0.6.1
govulncheck ./...                    # install: go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@v1.1.4
bash test/integration_test.sh ./crossagent   # requires a fresh build first
```

The GitHub CI runs all of the above (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `security.yml`). Catching issues locally saves a push-fix cycle.
